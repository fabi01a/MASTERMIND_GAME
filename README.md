🎯MASTERMIND - THE GAME
Mastermind is a number-guessing game where the player tries to crack a secret 4-number code generated by the computer. Each digit is between the numbers 0 and 7 and the player has 10 attempts to win.

This version is powerd by Flask, includes a terminal-based interface using blessed, and integrates with an external random number generator API to generate secure secret codes.

🧐HOW IT WORKS
• The computer generates a secret 4-number code
• After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
    • ✅ Correct number(s) in the correct position(s)
    • 🔁 Correct number(s) but in their wrong position(s)
    • ❌ Incorrect number(s) chosen
• The game tracks and displays the player's guesses in a clean terminal-based UI
• The player has 10 attempts to guess the correct 4-number sequence
• The game ends when the player wins, runs out of attempts, or if the user chooses to end the game early

🛠️REQUIREMENTS
This app is built with Python 3.11.4 and requires the following libraries:
    • [`requests`](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
    • [`flask`](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/)
    • [`pytest`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) (for testing)
    • [`blessed`](https://pypi.org/project/blessed/) (for CLI rendering)
    • random, time (built-in modules)

📦INSTALLATION
1. Clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/fabi01a/MASTERMIND_GAME.git
    cd MASTERMIND_GAME

2. Set up and activate your virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

You will be greeted with instructions in your terminal. Type in your 4-number guess or type QUIT to end the game at any time

💫EXTENTIONS/ENHANCEMENTS
In addition to the core functionality, this project includes:
• 🤩 Dynamic UI: Terminal UI updates on each guess with a displayed chart tracking the history of previous attempts
• 🥷 Fallback Logic: If the external API is not available, the game uses Python's build-in random as a fallback
• 🏓 Custom Feedback: User's receive personalized feedback after each guess
• ✌🏼 Early Exit Support: Quit before starting or anytime during the game

🧪RUNNING TESTS
From the project root, run:
    pytest

This will test:
• Game Creation
• Valid / Invalid guesses
• Win / Loss scenarios
• Input edgecases
• Post-game restrictions

Tests are located in tests/test_routes.py

📝NOTES
• The game uses /game and /game/<game_id>/guess endpoints
• Secret codes are generated using random.org API
• A create_app() factory is used for testing the Flask app
