# 🎯MASTERMIND - THE GAME

Mastermind is a number-guessing game where the player tries to crack a secret 4-number code generated by the computer. Each digit is between the numbers 0 and 7 and the player has 10 attempts to win.

This version is powerd by Flask, includes a terminal-based interface using blessed, and integrates with an external random number generator API to generate secure secret codes.

## 🧐HOW IT WORKS

- The computer generates a secret 4-number code
- After each guess, the game will provide feedback:

        • ✅ Correct number(s) in the correct position(s)

        • 🔁 Correct number(s) but in their wrong position(s)

        • ❌ Incorrect number(s) chosen

- The game tracks and displays the player's guesses in a clean terminal-based UI
- The player has 10 attempts to guess the correct 4-number sequence
- The game ends when the player wins, runs out of attempts, or if the user chooses to end the game early

## 💫EXTENTIONS & ENHANCEMENTS

In addition to the core functionality, this project includes:

- 🤩 **Dynamic UI:** Terminal UI updates on each guess with a displayed chart tracking the history of previous attempts

- 🥷 **Fallback Logic:** If the external API is not available, the game uses Python's build-in random as a fallback

- 🏓 **Custom Feedback:** User's receive personalized feedback after each guess

- ✌🏼**Early Exit Support:** Quit before starting or anytime during the game

## 🧪RUNNING TESTS

From the project root, run:

```bash
    pytest
```

This test suite covers:
- Game creation
- Valid / Invalid guesses
- Win / Loss scenarios
- Input edgecases
- Post-game restrictions

Tests are located in tests/test_routes.py

## 📝NOTES

- The game uses /game and /game/<game_id>/guess endpoints

- Secret codes are generated using random.org API

- A create_app() factory is used for testing purposes
